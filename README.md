# Boston-area-journalists-on-Mastodon
A running list of Boston-area journalists you can follow on Mastodon, with instructions on how to add them in bulk to your following lists. Maintained by [@cmilneil@better.boston](https://better.boston/@cmilneil)


## How to use this list
You can import this entire list into Mastodon to add them in bulk to the accounts that you follow. Here's how: 
1. Download the `bostonjournalists.csv` file above by right-clicking the file name and choosing "Save Link As...". Take note of where it's saved â€“ it'll usually go in your Downloads folder.
2. From your Mastodon home page on your desktop computer, navigate to your "settings" page (look for the gear icon), then choose "Import and Export > Import" from the sidebar menu. Alternatively, type in this URL into your browser's address bar: `https://[the URL of your instance]/settings/import`. If you're part of better.boston, for instance, you can type in [`https://better.boston/settings/import`](https://better.boston/settings/import).
3. From the Import page, choose "Following List" from the drop-down menu under "Import type," and make sure the "Merge" radio button is checked. Then upload the `bostonjournalists.csv` file you saved in step 1 by clicking the "Browse" button and locating the file where it's been saved on your hard drive.
4. Click the upload button. It may take a few minutes to process. 

## Updates
As more reporters and news organizations join Mastodon I plan to update this list on approximately a weekly basis (for now). If you have suggestions for new accounts to be added, [let me know by replying to this thread on Mastodon](https://better.boston/@cmilneil/109366554202086475).
